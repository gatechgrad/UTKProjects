Initial Visual Appearance                                          20 points

    There are two panels with the top panel		    2
       being the rotate panel and the bottom
       panel being the thermometer panel

    There is a horizontal line in the rotate                2
       panel and a label next to it that reads
       0

    5 labels evenly spaced and correctly labeled            3

    Control handle at the top of the mercury                2

    Thermometer centered and occupies 3/4 of the screen     2
       when application is initially displayed

    Temperature label centered next to the top              3
       of the mercury and displays the correct value

    Frame appears to be 1/15 as wide as it is tall          2

    Bulb diameter appears to be three times the frame	    2
       width

    Stem appears to be 1/10 the height of the metered       2
       segment

 Interaction                                                       50 points

    Eight selection handles appear when the left mouse      2
       button is pressed while the mouse cursor is
       inside the thermometer object

    The selection handles disappear if the left mouse       2
       button is pressed while the mouse cursor is
       outside the thermometer object

    Thermometer object is correctly scaled when each of     8
       the selection handles is dragged

    If the user drags the mouse cursor while it is in the   8
        bounding box of the entire thermometer object and 
	the left mouse button is down, then the thermometer 
	moves with the mouse cursor.

    The mercury moves correctly when the control handle     8
        is dragged and the temperature label updates
	appropriately (i.e., correct temperature and is
	an integer) and stays centered with respect
	to the mercury

    Rotation

        A red-filled, pie-shaped arc gets drawn out when    4
	    the user drags with the left mouse button

	The degrees label gets correctly updated and is     2
	    displayed as an integer 

	The thermometer object gets rotated correctly       8

        Scaling and mercury manipulation work correctly     8
	    after the thermometer object has been
	    rotated

Program Design	                                                    30 points

    General path object used for the frame		 5

    Text layout objects used for text labels and	 4
        degree labels

    Line2D objects used for tick marks                   3
