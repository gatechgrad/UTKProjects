<p>Redo lab6 using Java2D objects to draw your thermometer. Every object
you draw must either be a Java2D object or a TextLayout object. Recall
from lab 6 that you
<br>added the following functionality to the thermometer:
<ol>
<li>
Instead of labels representing the minimum and maximum values for the thermometer,
you should now have 5 evenly spaced tickmarks going from the minimum to
the maximum value. This means that you will have one tickmark at the minimum
and maximum values and three tick marks inbetween. The tickmarks should
have a dash and a label as demonstrated in the example program. 
You should draw the
labels using the TextLayout class and the dashes using the Line2D class.</li>

<li>
You should add a control handle to the top of the mercury that allows a
user to move the mercury up and down. The text label indicating the current
value of the mercury needs to move up and down as well and reflect the
updated value. This text label must be drawn using the TextLayout object
while the mercury should be drawn using a Rectangle2D object.</li>

<li>
You do <i>not </i>have to allow the user to edit the current value label
for this lab.</li>
</ol>
Additionally you must add the following additional functionality to your
thermometer:
<ol>
<li> Java 2D graphics make it much easier to center the thermometer object.
Therefore the thermometer object should meet the following
specifications for this lab:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The thermometer object should be initially centered in the window
and should occupy 3/4 of the height of the window. 
<li> The frame width should be 1/15 the height of the thermometer frame.
<li> The thermometer frame should be 1.1 times the height of the metered
portion of the thermometer (i.e., the visible portion of the 
"stem" should be .1 times the height
of the metered portion of the thermometer).
<li> The top of the bulb should be attached to the bottom of the thermometer
frame (the stem should extend to the middle of the bulb to prevent any gaps 
from appearing). 
<li> The bulb diameter should be 3 times the width of the frame.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
If the user drags the mouse cursor while it is in the bounding box of
the entire thermometer object and the left mouse button is down, then
the thermometer should move with the mouse cursor.</li>
<li>
If the user presses down with the left mouse button anywhere in the thermometer,
8 selection handles should appear around the boundary of the thermometer 
object. To keep the selection handles from bouncing back and forth as
the thermometer value grows and shrinks, make the right side of the 
thermometer object be the right side of the bulb rather than the maximum
of the right side of the bulb and the temperature label. </li>


<li>
If the user clicks the left mouse button outside the thermometer, the selection
handles should disappear.</li>

<li>
If the user presses on a selection handle with the left mouse button, the
thermometer should be scaled about the center of the object. That means that
the other side of the object will not be pinned but will be scaled as
well. It is okay if the
selection handles also get scaled.</li>

<li>
Add a second panel to your frame that controls the rotation of the 
thermometer. This panel should be added to the top (North) of your
frame. Initially a horizontal line will appear in this panel along with
a value denoting the current angle. The angle should be initially 0.
When the user drags with the mouse in this window, the line should follow
the mouse and sweep out a pie-shaped arc that is colored red. The text
label should be updated to reflect the current angle, in <i>degrees</i>.
You will need to use an Arc2D object with a PIE type. Unlike other Java
2D objects arcs use degrees. In order to calculate the degrees, you should
first convert your point to radians using the Math class's <tt>atan2</tt>
method and then convert the radians to degrees using the Math class's
<tt>toDegrees</tt> method. The <tt>atan2</tt> method returns a value between
-pi and pi while the arc needs an angle between 0 and 360 degrees so you
will have to do some work to make the necessary degree conversion even
after using the <tt>toDegrees</tt> method. You should use the angle that
you compute in radians as your rotation angle for the thermometer. The
thermometer should rotate as you drag the mouse in the rotate panel. To
ensure that this rotation happens, make sure that the mouse listener method
that you use calls repaint on the thermometer panel.

Lab Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li>
All objects must be drawn using either Java2D objects or TextLayout objects.</li>

<li>
The bulb and the stem protruding from the bulb must be constructed using
an Area object.</li>

<li>
The frame surrounding the rest of the thermometer must be constructed using a 
General Path object, so that the bottom part of the frame is open (i.e., the
frame and the area object should meet gracefully without any line crossing
at the intersection point).</li>

<li>
The "metered portion" of the thermometer that extends from the minimum 
temperature to the maximum temperature must be drawn in its own coordinate 
system, which is degrees.
Hence the bottom y value will be the thermometer's minimum temperature
and the top y value will be the thermometer's maximum temperature. The
x-coordinate system should start at 0 and I would recommend making the
mercury start at x-coordinate 0, which means that the labels and tick marks
will have negative x-values. 

<li> The bulb/stem object can have its own coordinate system which starts
at 0 and extends upward. The "metered" part of the thermometer should be
transformed so that it can be drawn in the bulb/stem object's coordinate
system.</li>

<li>
After the thermometer is first displayed, the thermometer's
position and size depends on the user's actions. If the window is
resized the thermometer should not be re-centered.</li>

<li>
You must use an AffineTransform to rotate, scale, and translate the thermometer
to the appropriate location on the screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Submission</h2>
Follow the submission guidelines for lab1
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Example</h2>
If you have questions about what your thermometer should look like or how
it should respond to user input, run the example program that is called
/home/bvz/cs594/labs/lab8/thermometerApplication. To run it you will need
to type:
<p>
<pre>
java lab8.thermometerApplication min max initial
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>min, max,</tt> and <tt>initial</tt> should be the minimum,
maximum, and initial values of the mercury.

<h2>
Hints</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Converting y-values in thermometer coordinates into y-values in device
coordinates. The quick answer is that if your temperature range is minValue
to maxValue then you scale by -1 and translate by maxValue. For example,
if maxValue is 100 and you have a point in temperature coordinates of 20,
then multiply 20 by -1 to get -20 and add 100 to get 80 and that is your
device coordinate for the point. The reason you scale by -1 is to flip
the y-axis for your temperature coordinates so that instead of pointing
up, it points down (effectively scaling by -1 reflects the y-axis about
the x-axis). Once it points down, it points in the same direction as the
coordinate axis for device coordinates. Once you've flipped the y-axis,
the maxValue of 100 is at -100 in device coordinates. It's supposed to
be at 0 in device coordinates, so you have to translate by 100 to get it
to 0.</li>
