<li> The design of a Silhouette canvas is as follows:
  <ol>
  <li> The Silhouette canvas maintains a list of z-depths. Each z-depth
      consists of a z-number and a list of objects at that depth.
  <li> A Silhouette canvas maintains a composite shape that holds the state
      information for a Silhouette canvas. This composite shape is made the
      parent for all objects added to a Silhouette canvas. It would be better
      to make the canvas itself be the parent for these objects, but that
      is impossible since a Silhouette canvas cannot implement the SilShape
      interface. By making the composite shape the objects' parent, they
      can at least query all of the canvas's state information transparently,
      as if it were a SilShape. If they need access to specific canvas
      information, they should call the getCanvas method instead.
