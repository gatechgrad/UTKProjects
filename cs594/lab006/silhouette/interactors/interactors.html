<ul>
<li> There is a single interactor handler for the whole silhouette system.
  <ol>
  <li> The interactor handler is responsible for handling all events that
        are directed to the silhouette canvases.
  <li> For each silhouette object, the interactor handler
        maintains a list of interactors that operate on the object.
  <li> When an interactor is added to an object, the object asks the
        interactor handler to add the interactor to the object's interactor
        list.
  <li> When an object is deleted, it notifies the interactor handler so the
        interactor handler can remove the object from the handler's data
        structures.
  <li> There are a number of reasons for having a single interactor handler
        for the whole silhouette system rather than one handler per canvas:
        <ol>
        <li> An object does not have to be attached to a canvas in order
                to attach interactors to the object.
        <li> If an object is removed from a canvas, and then either re-added
                to the canvas or added to another canvas, there is no need
                to transfer the object's interactor list between handlers.
                Further, if the object is not immediately re-connected to a
                canvas, there is no need to find a way to temporarily store
                its interactor list.
        <li> When an interactor is added to a canvas, there is no need to
                determine which canvas the object belongs to (not a big
                problem since we can simply chase parent pointers until we
                locate a canvas).
        </ol>
  </ol>
<li> When an event occurs, the interactor handler gets a stack of objects
        that contain the event.
        <ol>
        <li> The interactor handler then retrieves each object's
             list of interactors and determines whether any of the interactors
             handle the event.
        <li> If none of the interactors handle the event, the
             next object on the stack is tried.
        <li> An interactor handles the event by changing its state from start
             to some other state.
        <li> When the interactor is done, it sets its state to stop. The
             interactor handler resets the state to start.
        <li> When an interactor is handling events, it gets exclusive access
             to the events.
        </ol>
<li> An interactor implements the MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, and
      KeyListener interfaces. The rationale for this design
        is that interactors will allow us to create behaviors that involve
        multiple events and that must be handled by multiple adapter classes
        (e.g., a move behavior). An interactor does not have to support all
        of the AWT's event classes since it is only meant to handle input
        events. Hence an interactor can restrict itself to implementing the
        input listeners.
<li> If the programmer wants to activate an interactor so that it starts
      receiving all the input events, the programmer can call the
      startInteractor method.
<li> Each canvas has a variable called selectedObjects which an interactor
      can use to find the selected objects on that canvas.
