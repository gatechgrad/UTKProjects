The interactors package implements event-handling for Silhouette. Event-handling
for components is relatively simple since normally a component only implements
a few types of behaviors. For example, a button component implements a push
and release behavior. In contrast, a canvas with many custom graphical objects
may have to support a large number of behaviors, such as move/resize behaviors,
selection behaviors, and text editing behaviors. In such a situation, it becomes
much more difficult for a programmer to control the event-handling by writing
listener procedures. If the programmer tries to write just one listener, then
it has to deal with multiple behaviors. If the programmer tries to write
one listener for each behavior, then the programmer has to make sure that
a listener does not operate on an event that another listener wants.
<p>
For these reasons Silhouette uses the interactor model to implement behaviors.
Each interactor is responsible for implementing a single behavior.
Interactors implement the mouse listener, mouse motion listener, and
key listener interfaces, so a programmer can create an entire behavior
by overriding the appropriate methods in an interactor. Once an interactor
starts executing, it receives all events from the Silhouette event-handler.
An interactor stops executing by entering a STOP state. This state tells
the Silhouette event-handler to stop sending events to the interactor and
to reset the interactor's state to START. A more detailed description
of interactors can be found by looking at the package documentation for
interactors.
<p>
In keeping with the AWT's style of adding listeners to components, interactors
are added to Silhouette objects. When an interactor is added to a
Silhouette object (using the addInteractor method), the interactor will
operate on that object. In order to conserve space, it is better to create
one instance of an interactor and add it to multiple objects, rather than
creating multiple instances of an interactor and adding one instance to each
Silhouette object. For example, if there are 100 objects on a screen, it is
better to create one instance of a move interactor and add this instance
to each object then it is to create one instance of the move interactor for
each object on the screen.
<p>
Silhouette implements an event-handler that acts as a traffic cop
by distributing events to the appropriate interactor. When an interactor
is executing, the event-handler distributes all the events to that
interactor. If no interactor is executing, then Silhouette uses the
following algorithm to determine which interactor gets the event:
<ol>
<li> If the event is a mouse listener event, the event handler determines which
objects on the display contain the point at which the event occurred.
The interactors associated with the topmost object get the first crack at
the event. If none of the interactors wants to handle the event, then the
interactors associated with the composite object to which the topmost object
belongs gets a crack at the event. This passing of the event up the
composite object hierarchy continues until the canvas is reached. The
interactors attached to the canvas are asked if they want the event. If
not the event goes unprocessed.
<p>
<li> If the event is a key event, then the interactors associated with
  the canvas are asked to handle the event. If none of the interactors
  wants the event, the event goes unprocessed.
<p>
<li> If the event is a mouse motion event, the event is ignored. The rationale
  for ignoring such events is that many such events can get generated yet
  a behavior is unlikely to start on such an event.
</ol>
<p>
Two problems may seem apparent from the description of the above algorithm.
First, how would an interactor handling a key event know to which object(s) the
event should be applied? The answer is that each canvas keeps a list of
selected objects that may be accessed via the getSelectedObjects method.
Selection interactors can add or remove objects from this list, thus allowing
an interactor that uses key events to determine the selected objects. The
second problem is what the programmer should do if they want a behavior to
start on a mousemotion event. The answer is that they can attach a
mousemotion listener to the canvas. There is nothing to prevent a programmer
from attaching listeners to a Silhouette canvas. These listeners will
operate concurrently with the Silhouette event handler. In other words,
both these listeners and the Silhouette event handler will get the event.
That means that an interactor may consume the same event that one of the
programmer's listeners is consuming. For this reason, it is best to try
to implement a behavior as an interactor if at all possible.

<ul>
<li> There is a single interactor handler for the whole silhouette system.
  <ol>
  <li> The interactor handler is responsible for handling all events that
        are directed to the silhouette canvases.
  <li> For each silhouette object, the interactor handler
        maintains a list of interactors that operate on the object.
  <li> When an interactor is added to an object, the object asks the
        interactor handler to add the interactor to the object's interactor
        list.
  <li> When an object is deleted, it notifies the interactor handler so the
        interactor handler can remove the object from the handler's data
        structures.
  <li> There are a number of reasons for having a single interactor handler
        for the whole silhouette system rather than one handler per canvas:
        <ol>
        <li> An object does not have to be attached to a canvas in order
                to attach interactors to the object.
        <li> If an object is removed from a canvas, and then either re-added
                to the canvas or added to another canvas, there is no need
                to transfer the object's interactor list between handlers.
                Further, if the object is not immediately re-connected to a
                canvas, there is no need to find a way to temporarily store
                its interactor list.
        <li> When an interactor is added to a canvas, there is no need to
                determine which canvas the object belongs to (not a big
                problem since we can simply chase parent pointers until we
                locate a canvas).
        </ol>
  </ol>
<li> When an event occurs, the interactor handler gets a stack of objects
        that contain the event.
        <ol>
        <li> The interactor handler then retrieves each object's
             list of interactors and determines whether any of the interactors
             handle the event.
        <li> If none of the interactors handle the event, the
             next object on the stack is tried.
        <li> An interactor handles the event by changing its state from start
             to some other state.
        <li> When the interactor is done, it sets its state to stop. The
             interactor handler resets the state to start.
        <li> When an interactor is handling events, it gets exclusive access
             to the events.
        </ol>
<li> An interactor implements the MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, and
      KeyListener interfaces. The rationale for this design
        is that interactors will allow us to create behaviors that involve
        multiple events and that must be handled by multiple adapter classes
        (e.g., a move behavior). An interactor does not have to support all
        of the AWT's event classes since it is only meant to handle input
        events. Hence an interactor can restrict itself to implementing the
        input listeners.
<li> If the programmer wants to activate an interactor so that it starts
      receiving all the input events, the programmer can call the
      startInteractor method.
<li> Each canvas has a variable called selectedObjects which an interactor
      can use to find the selected objects on that canvas.
