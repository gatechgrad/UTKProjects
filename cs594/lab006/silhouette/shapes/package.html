The shapes package
contains all of the classes for creating and displaying Silhouette 
shapes.
<p>
The shapes package defines a number of types of objects that
support the display of custom graphics. The Java2D graphics
package also allows custom graphics to be displayed. However,
the shapes package provides a number of services not provided
by the Java2D package:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Automatic Redisplay: Whenever a Silhouette canvas's paint method
     is called, it automatically redraws all the Silhouette shapes and
     swing components that have been added to the canvas. The Java2D
     graphics model requires the programmer to manually erase and
     redraw all custom 2D shapes.
<p>
<li> Retained Object Model: Java2D provides a retained object model
     that keeps track of a shape's coordinates. Silhouette provide
     a beefed up retained object model that keeps track of a shape's
     other properties, such as its fill color, its line color, and
     whether or not it is visible. When a canvas's paint method is
     called, the canvas automatically sets the graphics context to
     an object's properties before drawing the object.
</ol>
<p>
Silhouette differs from the Java2D graphics package in the way it
displays objects on the screen. The Java2D graphics package requires
the programmer to explicitly call draw commands to display shapes
on the screen. In contrast, Silhouette requires the programmer to
1) create an instance of the shape to be drawn on the screen, 2) set
the display properties of the shape using the created object's various
set property methods, and 3) add the object to a Silhouette canvas.
Adding the object to the Silhouette canvas is like adding a Swing
component to a JComponent. It registers the shape with the canvas
so that the canvas knows about it and can draw it when the canvas's
paint method is called.
