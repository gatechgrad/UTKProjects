The samples package contains a number of sample files that show how the
various shapes supported by Silhouette can be created and drawn on
a display. Here is a list of the samples:
<p>
<ol>
<li>GoFrame: Draws a set of rectangles on the screen (called color chips)
	along with a feedback rectangle. When one of the colored
	rectangles is selected with the mouse cursor and moved, the
	feedback rectangle turns to the color of the selected rectangle.
	This application shows how to create rectangles and composite
	objects.
<p>
<li>TextFrame: Draws a couple of text shapes on the screen. This application
	shows how to create text objects.
<p>
<li>LineFrame: Draws a line on the screen and two counters that count the
	number of times a mouse cursor has 1) selected the line, and 
	2) missed selecting the line. When the mouse cursor is pressed
	while over the line, the hit counter will be incremented by one;
	otherwise the miss counter will be incremented by one. This
	application shows how to create line and text objects. It also
	shows how text objects can be positioned.
<p>
<li>ImageFrame: Draws a gif on the screen and resizes the canvas to 
	be the same size as the gif. This application shows how to
	create images and how to resize canvases.
